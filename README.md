# Katas


How to you get to be a great musician? Ultimately, greatness comes
from practicing; applying the theory over and over and over, using
feedback to get better every time.

We need practice sessions.

## The Kata

    - You need time without interruptions
    - You need to try it as many times as it takes
    - There needs to be no pressure
    - You must be confortable making mistakes
    
*A good session*: You came out of it knowing more than when you went in.
